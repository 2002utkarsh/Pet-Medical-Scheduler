# Pet Medical Scheduler

Welcome to the Pet Medical Scheduler project! This is a Java-based application developed as the final project for the Department of Electrical and Software Engineering at the Schulich School of Engineering. The project demonstrates the principles of software development using Java.

## Overview

Wildlife rescue centers often need to manage and schedule tasks related to caring for injured and orphaned animals. This project addresses the needs of a client, Example Wildlife Rescue (EWR), which specializes in medium-sized animals like coyotes, foxes, porcupines, beavers, and raccoons.

The goal of this project is to create a program that can generate daily task schedules for volunteers at EWR. The tasks include feeding, administering medications, and other care-related activities. The program aims to optimize the schedule while ensuring that animals receive the necessary care.

## Features

- **Task Scheduling**: The program schedules tasks for various animals, taking into account their care needs and time constraints.

- **Efficiency**: The scheduler tries to group similar tasks together to improve efficiency and minimize the need for backup volunteers.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The program incorporates a user-friendly GUI to interact with users and provide task schedules.

- **Backup Volunteer**: In cases where it's impossible to fit all the tasks into a schedule, the program considers the use of backup volunteers.

## Team Collaboration

This project was developed by a team of 3 or 4 members who worked collaboratively to complete the development tasks. We used a private GitHub repository for collaboration and version control.

## Usage

To use the Wildlife Rescue Task Scheduler:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java program.
3. Run the program and follow the instructions provided in the user interface.
4. Generate daily task schedules for animal care at wildlife rescue centers.
